# Conclusion

You were doing a great job! However there is a big big room for improvement. I would suggest more to use Server Side Components and Server Action to get better benefits from Nextjs.

Be careful with the old way of React, it might not be the best way to do things in Nextjs. I would suggest you to try out the new way of doing things in Nextjs.

Good luck! ðŸš€
